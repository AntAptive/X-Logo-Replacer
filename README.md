### This extension is designed for **CHROMIUM-BASED BROWSERS ONLY!**

Please note that this GitHub repo contains the source code files to the extension. Most browsers have security in place that may block this extension from being installed via the CRX file.<br>
***The extension does nothing malicious. All source code for the extension is in this repo.***<br>
For the most optimal results, please check out the extension on the Opera Store and Chrome Web Store pages. *(COMING SOON, they're still being approved!)*<br>

### **The extension should only be downloaded here if absolutely necessary.**

# How to use
Simply install the plugin, and using the extension popup, set the text to whatever you want and enable the extension!<br>
The change will take effect every time Twitter is initially loaded.

# How to install
1. Check our [Releases page](https://github.com/AntAptive/x-logo-replacer/releases) to download the latest release.
2. Download the CRX file and drop it into your browser's extensions page. Usually you can drop it anywhere.

## If the extension fails to load or gets blocked by your browser
1. Download the source code ZIP instead of the CRX file.
2. Delete the files `README.md` and `xLogoReplacerBanner.png` from the root folder.
3. Ensure your browser has Developer Mode on. Usually there's a tickbox on your browser's extension page.
4. Extract the ZIP to a folder and load the extension "unpacked".
